This Governance [Poll](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.1.9.2_Atlas_Edit_Weekly_Cycle-4a8ad9ad-5c5d-4994-9b46-f04c0e61ce59%7C0db30308) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, April 14 at 16:00 UTC.

Please review the previous [Atlas Edit in Notion](https://www.notion.so/Public-Atlas-Edit-Weekly-Proposal-for-Agent-Launch-Week-of-2025-03-10-1aff2ff08d738081880fcdc15ceb12b0?pvs=21) for this Edit's changes to the `Integration Boost Partners` section.

A brief summary of this Atlas Edit has been provided by the Author and is shown below:

*With DAI and USDS already present and profitable on Ethereum, resources to promote USDS are best spent on new markets. To this end, the Integration Boost program should direct 100% of its budget to venues and partners outside of Ethereum and it’s associated L2’s where there is the highest potential for growth.*

*To add, Sky is quite profitable but much of this is currently being spent rather than given back to token holders. Integration boosts should be focused on high value returns. Realistically almost all Sky income is derived from Ethereum as low gas means the L2’s have lost much of their meaning/drive. Benefits gained from L2 network deposits are only driven by large subsidies such that Sky is losing out overall. A great example is on Compound, sure it’s great that people are depositing USDS and borrowing USDS on compound. But we’re paying USDS incentives to achieve this. They can just deposit USDS on Sky. Perhaps when USDS was unknown it was good publicity (people see the high APR and google USDS to find it) but now USDS is known so we no longer need efforts such as this on ETH.*

## Outcomes

This poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value. The Minimum Positive Participation for Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposals is currently set to **10,000 MKR**.

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option AND the votes for the 'Yes' option equal or exceed 10,000 MKR, then the following action will be taken:**

- An associated Pull Request will be merged into The Atlas.
